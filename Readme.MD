# Overview

This program uses Django, HTML and Bootstrap CSS to create a web application. Bootstrap makes it easy to include CSS into your program, it's a css framework. 

I decided to use Django because it makes it easy to integrate your frontend website with your backend. Also, it basically does most of the work for you.

I have built a website where users generate passwords. How strong the password is depends on the user input. If the user wants numbers and uppercase letters to be included, the app will automatically do it. 

To run the app you would need to install Django. Also you would need to run the manage.py to start the server.

`pip install Django`

1. Open the Django folder.
2. In the terminal do this
`python manage.py runserver`

The app will automatically open your browser and display the website.
enjoy

The app contains 3 pages.
Home - contains app
Dynamically typed page - contains the password.
About - contains a little information about me.
